GUI growing flaw
When town grow mechanism Normal is selected and when town is supplied, but has no transport service,
as required in normal OpenTTD for town growing, GUI will incorrectly say town is growing even when it is
in fact not.
Currently games script cannot recognize whether town is or is not growing because of missing transport service.
You can support adding new API for this by voting in https://bugs.openttd.org/task/5934?project=1&pagenum=3
